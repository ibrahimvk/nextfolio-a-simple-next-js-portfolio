          Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ibrahim,
          I donâ€™t know what your dayâ€™s been like, but if itâ€™s heavy, pause, breathe. You donâ€™t have to have it all figured out.
          Some things take time, and thatâ€™s okay. Youâ€™re allowed to rest. Youâ€™re allowed to not be okay.
          But please donâ€™t forget, even quiet progress is still progress.
          You matter, even on the days you feel invisible.
          Iâ€™m rooting for you, genuinely.
        </p>
      </div>
      <Footer />
    </section>
