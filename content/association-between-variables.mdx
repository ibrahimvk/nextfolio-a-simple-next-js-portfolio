Understanding how variables relate to each other is crucial in data science. This guide explains different types of associations, how to measure them, and how to visualize them, based on **Week 4 of the Statistics-1 course** from IIT Madras' BS in Data Science program.

## 1. Review of Basic Statistical Concepts

Before exploring associations, let's recap some fundamental statistical concepts:

### Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes and presents data.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Uses samples to make inferences about a population.

### Variables and Data Types

- **Variables and Cases**: Columns in a dataset represent variables, rows represent cases.
- **Data Classification**:
  - **Categorical Data**: Divided into groups (e.g., gender, city).
  - **Numerical Data**: Quantitative values.
    - **Discrete**: Countable values (e.g., number of students).
    - **Continuous**: Measurable values (e.g., height, weight).
- **Scales of Measurement**:
  - **Nominal**: Categories with no order (e.g., colors).
  - **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (e.g., education level).
  - **Interval**: Numeric with equal intervals, no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).
  - **Ratio**: Numeric with equal intervals and a true zero (e.g., weight).

### Describing Data

- **Categorical Data**: Frequency tables, bar charts, pie charts.
- **Numerical Data**:
  - **Central Tendency**: Mean, median, mode.
  - **Dispersion**: Range, variance, standard deviation.
  - **Graphical Summaries**: Histograms, stem-and-leaf plots.

## 2. Association Between Two Categorical Variables

### Contingency Tables

A **contingency table** helps analyze relationships between two categorical variables.

#### Example:
- **Variables**: Gender (Male, Female) and Smartphone Ownership (Yes, No).
- **Data Collection**: 100 students surveyed.

#### Constructing a Contingency Table in Google Sheets:
1. Select data (e.g., Gender & Smartphone Ownership columns).
2. Insert a pivot table.
3. Add **Gender** under Rows and **Smartphone Ownership** under Columns.
4. Summarize by count.

### Relative Frequencies

- **Row Relative Frequency** = Cell count / Row total.
- **Column Relative Frequency** = Cell count / Column total.

### Identifying Associations

- **If frequencies remain constant**, no association exists.
- **If frequencies vary**, the variables are associated.

### Visualizing with Stacked Bar Charts

- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Show proportions of one categorical variable within another.
- **100% Stacked Bar Charts**: Show part-to-whole relationships.

## 3. Association Between Two Numerical Variables

### Scatter Plots

Scatter plots visualize relationships between two numerical variables.

#### Example:
- **Age (x-axis)** vs. **Height (y-axis)**

#### Constructing Scatter Plots in Google Sheets:
1. Select numerical columns.
2. Insert a scatter chart.
3. Ensure the explanatory variable is on the x-axis.

### Describing Associations

- **Direction**:
  - Positive: As *x* increases, *y* increases.
  - Negative: As *x* increases, *y* decreases.
- **Form**: Linear or curvilinear.
- **Strength**: Strong (tight clustering) or weak (spread out).
- **Outliers**: Deviate from the overall trend.

### Covariance

Measures how two variables move together.

#### Formula:
$$ s_{xy} = \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{n-1} $$

- **Positive covariance**: Both variables move in the same direction.
- **Negative covariance**: Variables move in opposite directions.
- **Google Sheets**:
  - `COVARIANCE.P`: Population covariance.
  - `COVARIANCE.S`: Sample covariance.

### Correlation

A unit-less measure of association strength.

#### Formula:
$$ r = \frac{cov(x, y)}{s_x s_y} $$

- **r ≈ +1**: Strong positive association.
- **r ≈ -1**: Strong negative association.
- **r ≈ 0**: Weak or no association.
- **Google Sheets**: `CORREL(x, y)`.

### Fitting a Line

If the relationship is linear, fit a line using:
$$ y = mx + c $$

- **Google Sheets**:
  1. Create a scatter plot.
  2. Add a trendline.
  3. Display the equation and R² value.
- **R-squared (R²)**:
  - Closer to 1: Strong fit.
  - Closer to 0: Weak fit.

## 4. Association Between Categorical and Numerical Variables

### Example:
A teacher investigates whether **gender** affects **exam scores**.

### Approach:
1. **Code Categorical Variable**: Assign numerical values (Male = 0, Female = 1).
2. **Scatter Plot**: Plot coded gender vs. scores.
3. **Point Bi-Serial Correlation Coefficient**:
   - Measures association between a numerical variable and a binary categorical variable.
   - Formula:
     $$ r_{pb} = \frac{\bar{y_1} - \bar{y_0}}{s_x} \sqrt{p_0 p_1} $$

### Interpretation

- **|r| close to 1**: Strong association.
- **|r| close to 0**: Weak association.
- **Sign of r** depends on category coding.
